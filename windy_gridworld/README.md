The details of the problem can be found in page 130 of the book.
The goal here is to learn how to evaluate action-value function with SARSA(TD based method).


## Comments
- I made several callable classes because each class needs to maintain a (constant variable). The same could be done with a regular function. What is a better way?
- I tried to use dictionary data structure since indexing with varible(that has a name) is more readable than indexing with a number.
