## Random Walk

The details of the problem can be found in page 125 of the book.  
Jupyter notebook file contains code and resulting plots.  
Regarding implementation, I tried to make use of class inheritance and basic python data structure(not numpy).


## Comments
- I feel that some work could be done to reflect theory in inheritance structure. And need to put more thoughts on methods.
